Title: Movie Recommender System with Content-Based Filtering (TMDB 5000 Movies)

Description:

This repository implements a content-based movie recommendation system using Python. It leverages the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset from Kaggle to recommend movies based on their similarity to a user's preferences.

Key Features:

Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes movie descriptions and genres to identify similar content for recommendations.
Text Vectorization: Employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent movie descriptions as numerical vectors, enabling efficient similarity calculations.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between movie vectors using cosine similarity, providing a robust metric for movie recommendations.

Example Usage:

The script will prompt you to enter a movie title from the dataset. It will then analyze the movie's description and genre, calculate its similarity to other movies, and recommend the top N most similar movies (where N is a user-defined parameter).

Further Enhancements (Optional):

Explore alternative similarity metrics for potentially improved recommendations.
Incorporate user ratings to personalize recommendations using collaborative filtering techniques.
Develop a user interface for a more interactive experience.
