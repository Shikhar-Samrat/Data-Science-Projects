# Data 
This repository serves as a central hub for my various data science projects. It provides a structured and accessible way to showcase my work and allows others to explore, learn from, and potentially contribute to these projects.

## Project Structure:

Each data science project will reside in its own subfolder within this repository. Within each subfolder, you'll typically find the following structure (adapt as needed):

README.md: This file provides a concise overview of the project, including its purpose, methodology, key findings, and instructions for running the code (if applicable).
data/: This folder may contain the raw data used in the project. If the data is publicly available online, consider including a link to the source. If the data is sensitive or proprietary, you might just mention its type and characteristics.
notebooks/: This folder (or scripts/) may contain Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts that implement the data analysis and modeling.
output/: This folder may contain any generated results, visualizations, or reports produced by the project.
requirements.txt (optional): This file lists the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project's code.
Contribution Guidelines:

If you're interested in contributing to any of my projects, feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests. Here are some general guidelines:

Clearly document any changes you make to the code or project structure.
Adhere to existing coding conventions and style guides (if any).
Ensure your code is well-commented and readable for others.
Consider testing your changes to maintain project integrity.
