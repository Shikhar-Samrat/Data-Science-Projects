# Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-rays | Deep Learning
This repository serves as a central hub for my various data science projects. It provides a structured and accessible way to showcase my work and allows others to explore, learn from, and potentially contribute to these projects.

## Overview

Pneumonia is a serious medical condition that often requires timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Chest X-rays are a common diagnostic tool for pneumonia, and this project aims to automate the detection process using deep learning techniques.

### Key Features

1. Custom CNN Architecture: Implemented a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 3 convolutional layers and max-pooling to extract relevant features from Chest X-ray images.
2. ImageDataGenerator: Employed TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator for image preprocessing, enhancing the model's robustness by performing data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping.
3. Adam Optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy: Utilized Adam optimizer for model training and sparse categorical crossentropy as the loss function to handle multi-class classification.
4. Validation Accuracy: Achieved a validation accuracy of 93.75%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture.

### Requirements:

1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow 2.x
3. numpy
4. matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

### Acknowledgments:
This project was inspired by the need for accurate and efficient pneumonia detection methods using deep learning techniques.
